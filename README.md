# Text Sorting Script

This script takes user input containing strings separated by the '+' character, sorts them in alphabetical order, and concatenates them back with the '+' character. The sorted text is then printed to the console.

## Usage

1. Run the script.
2. Enter the desired text with strings separated by '+'.
3. The sorted text will be displayed.

Feel free to improve or modify the script as needed.
